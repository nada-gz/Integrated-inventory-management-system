# Integrated-inventory-management-system
A management system for a factory that includes spare parts and their associated suppliers. The system leverages various data structures, including linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees, to manage and organize inventory information efficiently.

[This](https://github.com/nada-gz/Integrated-inventory-management-system/blob/main/Management_System.cpp)
is the full program and the only file existed. By opening and running, you will get access to a variety of systems where you can manage and switch between them.

### Manual:

    1 or 2. Linked List System:
    
        here you can manage spare parts or suppliers lists by adding, displaying, or modifying them.

    3. Binary Search Tree System:
    
        by choosing this option, all the data stored in the linked list system will be saved in a sorted way in a BST.

       Then you will have control of this tree:

         i or ii. You can manage the spare parts tree or the supplier tree by inserting, searching, deleting, or modifying.

         iii. This option allows you to set up the database of each supplier (You enter the number of spare parts you want to assign to a specific supplier, then enter the part number of each spare part).

       Then if you want to see the data of all the spare parts of a supplier, you can go for choices iv, v:

         iv. This allows to print only the parts numbers of each spare part.

         v. This is more general, it prints the whole data of them including name, number, cost, and quality.

         vi and vii. These are the same options that will be mentioned in 4 and 5. They allow for operating the stack and queue systems.

    4. Stack System: 
    
        This displays a history for managing all of the user interactions during data input (LIFO). 

    5. Queue System: 
        
        This displays the steps the user encountered while processing or modifying the data (FIFO).
